## üéØ What Was Easy or Difficult and Why

### Easy

#### 1. **Component Structure and Organization**
- **Why Easy**: The modular component structure with clear separation of UI components and feature components made the codebase easy to navigate and extend.

#### 2. **Type Safety with tRPC and Prisma**
- **Why Easy**: The combination of Prisma's type generation and tRPC's type inference created excellent end-to-end type safety with minimal boilerplate.

#### 3. **React Query Integration**
- **Why Easy**: React Query's caching and invalidation strategies worked seamlessly with tRPC, making data fetching straightforward and efficient.

#### 4. **Tailwind CSS Styling**
- **Why Easy**: Tailwind's utility-first approach made implementing designs fast and consistent without writing custom CSS.

#### 5. **Filter and Search Logic**
- **Why Easy**: The Prisma ORM made building complex filter and search queries straightforward with its query builder API.

### Difficult

#### 1. **Prisma Client Generation Issues**
- **Why Difficult**: Encountered permission errors with Prisma's engine cache directory on macOS, requiring workarounds with environment variables.
- **Solution**: Used `SKIP_POSTINSTALL_GENERATE` and `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` flags to bypass cache issues.

#### 2. **Dynamic Table Columns**
- **Why Difficult**: Implementing dynamic columns based on active filters required careful state management and conditional rendering logic.
- **Challenge**: Maintaining proper column alignment and styling when columns appear/disappear.

#### 3. **URL State Management**
- **Why Difficult**: Syncing URL query parameters with component state while maintaining backward compatibility required careful orchestration.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring URL updates don't cause unnecessary re-renders while keeping state in sync.

#### 4. **Optimistic Updates**
- **Why Difficult**: Implementing optimistic updates for todos while ensuring cache consistency and handling rollbacks on errors.
- **Solution**: Used React Query's `useMutation` with `onMutate`, `onError`, and `onSettled` callbacks.

#### 5. **Table Row Spacing and Styling**
- **Why Difficult**: Achieving proper spacing between table rows with shadows required using `border-separate` layout, which introduced complexity with border styling.
- **Challenge**: Balancing visual design with table semantic structure.

#### 6. **Data Seeding with External API**
- **Why Difficult**: Fetching data from DummyJSON API and parsing complex nested JSON structures (bank, crypto) into SQLite.
- **Challenge**: Handling API rate limits and managing large datasets efficiently.
